Basically Khaybar, but with acrylic background blur UwU

![PreviewGIF](/Preview.gif)

right click the skin and press 'Settings...' to change the settings. You can replace the user image in `Khaybar\@Resources`.

This 'top bar' is NOT a replacement for the taskbar or any other Windows functionality. 
Unfortunately, you really do need the latest version of Rainmeter for this skin.
